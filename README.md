The project includes 4 files:
- Company_Logs_presentation.pdf is the project poster
- Company Logs (3).ipynb is the file submitted as "Initial steps of the project"
- Efficiency_analysis.ipynb contains the employee efficiency analysis (it does not duplicate the file containing "initial steps of the project" (Company Logs (3).ipynb)
- Model.ipynb contains the regression model (in the beginning of the file there are some repetitions with the analysis part)  

(Because we used jupyter files, version control has not been used. Instead we coordinated our efforts outside of git.)
